<title>How to install OpenVPN server on Ubuntu 14.04 - A Step-by-Step Guide - Wiseindy</title>




<meta name="description" content="This is a detailed &amp; step-by-step guide that will show you how to install and configure OpenVPN on Ubuntu 14.04. You can use OpenVPN to access the Internet safely and securely while on the move. To learn more about OpenVPN, you can check out the Wikipedia link or read about it on the official siteWhat you need:  An Ubuntu 14.04 system.  Root access  And as always, an internet connectionThis guide is split into 4 main sections.Don’t worry if the titles look intimidating. If you follow the instructions, it should go smoothly and you should have a functioning OpenVPN server to which you can connect to from anywhere and using any device.  Installation and configuration of OpenVPN server  Creating a Certificate Authority and Server-Side Certificate and Key  Generate Certificates and Keys for your devices  Create a Unified OpenVPN Profile for each of your devicesPart 1Installation and configuration of OpenVPN serverStep 1.1:First, update your package lists and then install the openvpn and easy-rsa package.sudo apt-get updatesudo apt-get install openvpn easy-rsaStep 1.2:From now onwards, all the steps below have to be run as root. So, go ahead and login as root.suStep 1.3:Lets extract the sample VPN server configuration file to this location: /etc/openvpngunzip -c /usr/share/doc/openvpn/examples/sample-config-files/server.conf.gz &gt; /etc/openvpn/server.confNote: gunzip is a utility that uncompresses a gzip file. gz or .Z is the extension for gzip files.Step 1.4:Still as root, open this file.I prefer vim to open files on ubuntu. If you prefer nano instead, you can use that too.vi /etc/openvpn/server.confStep 1.5:Now, we have to modify a few lines in this file.Search for a section that looks like this# Diffie hellman parameters.# Generate your own with:#   openssl dhparam -out dh1024.pem 1024# Substitute 2048 for 1024 if you are using# 2048 bit keys.dh dh1024.pemChange dh1024.pem to dh2048.pem. This doubles the RSA key length when we generate the server and client keys later in the guide.Step 1.6:Find and uncomment the line below. To uncomment, simply remove the semicolon ; in front of the line.Before:# If enabled, this directive will configure# all clients to redirect their default# network gateway through the VPN, causing# all IP traffic such as web browsing and# and DNS lookups to go through the VPN# (The OpenVPN server machine may need to NAT# or bridge the TUN/TAP interface to the internet# in order for this to work properly).;push &quot;redirect-gateway def1 bypass-dhcp&quot;After:# If enabled, this directive will configure# all clients to redirect their default# network gateway through the VPN, causing# all IP traffic such as web browsing and# and DNS lookups to go through the VPN# (The OpenVPN server machine may need to NAT# or bridge the TUN/TAP interface to the internet# in order for this to work properly).push &quot;redirect-gateway def1 bypass-dhcp&quot;This makes sure that the OpenVPN server will pass the client device’s web traffic to its destination.Step 1.7:Still in the same file, find and uncomment the following two lines. To uncomment, simply remove the semicolon ; in front of the two lines.Before:# Certain Windows-specific network settings# can be pushed to clients, such as DNS# or WINS server addresses.  CAVEAT:# http://openvpn.net/faq.html#dhcpcaveats# The addresses below refer to the public# DNS servers provided by opendns.com.;push &quot;dhcp-option DNS 208.67.222.222&quot;;push &quot;dhcp-option DNS 208.67.220.220&quot;After:# Certain Windows-specific network settings# can be pushed to clients, such as DNS# or WINS server addresses.  CAVEAT:# http://openvpn.net/faq.html#dhcpcaveats# The addresses below refer to the public# DNS servers provided by opendns.com.push &quot;dhcp-option DNS 208.67.222.222&quot;push &quot;dhcp-option DNS 208.67.220.220&quot;The two IP addresses above belong to OpenDNS and will be used to lookup DNS request where possible. You can use any DNS service of your choice. Here we have used OpenDNS, and hence their IP addresses are listed in the file.Step 1.8:This is the last thing to change in the file. Look for this section below and uncomment the two lines by removing the semicolons ;Before:# You can uncomment this out on# non-Windows systems.;user nobody;group nogroupAfter:# You can uncomment this out on# non-Windows systems.user nobodygroup nogroupSave and close the file.Step 1.9:Packet ForwardingWe need to now enable an option that allows the server to forward traffic from client devices out to the Internet. If this is not done, the client traffic will stop at the server. To enable packet forwarding, run this command.echo 1 &gt; /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forwardThis setting is not yet permanent and will not survive a reboot. To make it permanent, we need to edit the sysctl.conf file.vi /etc/sysctl.confIn this file, find and uncomment the following line. To uncomment, remove the # in front of the line.Before:# Uncomment the next line to enable packet forwarding for IPv4#net.ipv4.ip_forward=1After:# Uncomment the next line to enable packet forwarding for IPv4net.ipv4.ip_forward=1Save the file and exit.Step 1.10:Set up firewall rules in the Uncomplicated Firewall (ufw)We will be using OpenVPN over UDP, so the firewall must allow UDP traffic over port 1194.Still as root, enter the following command:ufw allow 1194/udpOpen the firewall’s (ufw) primary configuration file. We habe to set the firewall forwarding policy.vi /etc/default/ufwSearch for the string DEFAULT_FORWARD_POLICY=&quot;DROP&quot; in this file. Change the DROP to ACCEPT.Before:DEFAULT_FORWARD_POLICY=&quot;DROP&quot;After:DEFAULT_FORWARD_POLICY=&quot;ACCEPT&quot;Save the file and exit.Step 1.11:There’s one more step before we can move on to the next section.We need to add add additional firewall rules.Open this filevi /etc/ufw/before.rulesWe will be adding rules for NAT (network address translation) and IP masquerading of connected devices.Modify this file to look like this.Before:## rules.before## Rules that should be run before the ufw command line added rules. Custom# rules should be added to one of these chains:#   ufw-before-input#   ufw-before-output#   ufw-before-forward## Don&#39;t delete these required lines, otherwise there will be errors*filterAfter:## rules.before## Rules that should be run before the ufw command line added rules. Custom# rules should be added to one of these chains:#   ufw-before-input#   ufw-before-output#   ufw-before-forward################################### START OPENVPN RULES# NAT table rules*nat:POSTROUTING ACCEPT [0:0] # Allow traffic from OpenVPN client to eth0-A POSTROUTING -s 10.8.0.0/8 -o eth0 -j MASQUERADECOMMIT# END OPENVPN RULES################################## Don&#39;t delete these required lines, otherwise there will be errors*filterOnce you’ve added the section, enable the firewall (ufw).ufw enable                   Part 2Creating a Certificate Authority and Server-Side Certificate and KeyOkay, so we have installed and configured OpenVPN and the firewall settings in the above section. Now, let’s go ahead and create certificates and keys for our new OpenVPN server.Creating a certificate authority (CA)Step 2.1:Make sure you’re still logged in as root.Copy the Easy-RSA generation scripts to /etc/openvpncp -r /usr/share/easy-rsa/ /etc/openvpnStep 2.2:Now, create a directory to store our keys.mkdir /etc/openvpn/easy-rsa/keysStep 2.3:Now we will edit the vars file and add in some default values for a person or a business. The information that is entered into this file will be copied to the certificates and keys and will help us in identifying them later.You can put in any values you like. Here is an example.export KEY_COUNTRY=&quot;CA&quot;export KEY_PROVINCE=&quot;ON&quot;export KEY_CITY=&quot;Toronto&quot;export KEY_ORG=&quot;Wiseindy&quot;export KEY_EMAIL=&quot;wiseindy@example.com&quot;export KEY_OU=&quot;WiseOU&quot;There is one more line to edit in this file before you close it. We need to set the default filename for the server key and certificate. In this tutorial we’ve used the name server for simplicity. If you’re using a different name, please make sure you replace server with your custom name in the commands.export KEY_NAME=&quot;server&quot;Save and close the file.Step 2.4:The next step is to generate the Diffie-Hellman parameters.openssl dhparam -out /etc/openvpn/dh2048.pem 2048Step 2.5:Now, navigate to the easy-rsa directory.cd /etc/openvpn/easy-rsaStep 2.6:Once you’re in the easy-rsa directory, run the following command to initialize the PKI (Public Key Infrastructure).. ./varsNote the . (dot) and ` ` (space) in front of ./vars.The above command will output the following:NOTE: If you run ./clean-all, I will be doing a rm -rf on /etc/openvpn/easy-rsa/keysYou can ignore this warning message since we haven’t yet generated anything.Step 2.7:Let’s clear the working directory of any example keys and start fresh../clean-allStep 2.8:We are all set to create our certificate authority now. When you run the following command, it will ask you to confirm the values you had entered in the vars file in step 2.6. Hit enter to confirm the values../build-caGenerate a Certificate and Key for the ServerStep 2.9:Well, we now have a certificate authority (CA) set up. Let’s build our server key now../build-key-server serverNote: Note that I’ve used the name server in the above command. This is because I’ve set export KEY_NAME=&quot;server&quot; in the vars file (step 2.6). If you’ve used a different name, make sure you modify the command accordinglyWhen you run this command, you’ll see a similar output as the previous step. You can hit enter to confirm them. However, this time you will see two additional prompts.Please enter the following &#39;extra&#39; attributesto be sent with your certificate requestA challenge password []:An optional company name []:Both of the should be left blank. Hit Enter to continue.When it prompts you to sign the certificate and commit, type y for both the prompts and hit enter.Sign the certificate? [y/n]  y1 out of 1 certificate requests certified, commit? [y/n]  yNow you should see the following output. This means that all is good so far.Write out database with 1 new entriesData Base UpdatedStep 2.10Move the Server Certificates and KeysWell, we’ve now generated the server CA, keys and certificate. Let’s copy these over to the correct location /etc/openvpn/.cp /etc/openvpn/easy-rsa/keys/{server.crt,server.key,ca.crt} /etc/openvpnStep 2.11Well, guess what? Our OpenVPN server is ready now. Let’s start it.service openvpn startPart 3Generate Certificates and Keys for your devicesIn the previous section, we created the key and certificate for our server. We are going to do that for our devices now.We will build one for a client device called myphone. You can name your client device anything. Just make sure to substitute the name in the commands that follow.Step 3.1:You should still be root and still working from this directory /etc/openvpn/easy-rsa../build-key myphoneLike in the previous steps, you’ll be asked to confirm the Distinguised Name variables. Hit enter to accept the defaults.Step 3.2:Now copy the sample client configuration file to the easy-rsa/keys directory. This file will be used as a template. We will be editing this template file for each of our devices.cp /usr/share/doc/openvpn/examples/sample-config-files/client.conf /etc/openvpn/easy-rsa/keys/myphone.ovpnYou can repeat this section (steps 3.1 and 3.2) for each client device. Just make sure you use a different name for each of your devices (in this case we’ve used myphone)Part 4Create a Unified OpenVPN Profile for each of your devicesNow that you have created keys and certificates for your device myphone, let’s create one unified .ovpn file which will contain all this information.Step 4.1:From the /etc/openvpn/easy-rsa directory, copy the following files to your computer (the one you’re reading this article on). We will be editing these in a text editor (Notepad, TextEdit, etc.).myphone.crtmyphone.keymyphone.ovpnca.crtStep 4.2Open the myphone.ovpn file in a text editor like Notepad (Windows) or TextEdit (macOS) or whatever you prefere, really.Add your server’s IP address to the this section in the beginning of the file. Replace my-server-1 with your server’s IP address.Before:# The hostname/IP and port of the server.# You can have multiple remote entries# to load balance between the servers.remote my-server-1 1194After:# The hostname/IP and port of the server.# You can have multiple remote entries# to load balance between the servers.remote 142.189.11.1 1194Step 4.3In the same file, scroll down and uncomment this section (This doesn’t apply to Windows, so you can skip it if you’re going to use thie VPN profile on a Windows machine).Before:# Downgrade privileges after initialization (non-Windows only);user nobody;group nogroupAfter:# Downgrade privileges after initialization (non-Windows only)user nobodygroup nogroupStep 4.4:Scroll further down and this time you’ll comment a few lines instead of uncommenting. We do this because we are directly including the .crt and .key files within this .ovpn file.Before:# SSL/TLS parms.# . . .ca ca.crtcert client.crtkey client.keyAfter:# SSL/TLS parms.# . . .#ca ca.crt#cert client.crt#key client.keyStep 4.5:At the end of the file, add this text to block outside DNS# Prevent DNS leakblock-outside-dnsStep 4.6:Now, at the end of the file, we will be copying and pasting the contents of ca.crt, myphone.crt, and myphone.key files.Open the .crt and .key files in a text editor and copy-paste the content as shown belowThis is how we will be doing it.&lt;ca&gt;  (insert ca.crt here)&lt;/ca&gt;&lt;cert&gt;  (insert myphone.crt here)&lt;/cert&gt;&lt;key&gt;  (insert myphone.key here)&lt;/key&gt;Once you’re done copy-pasting the content, the end of your .ovpn file should look like this:&lt;ca&gt;-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----. . .-----END CERTIFICATE-----&lt;/ca&gt;  &lt;cert&gt;Certificate:. . .-----END CERTIFICATE-----. . .-----END CERTIFICATE-----&lt;/cert&gt;  &lt;key&gt;-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----. . .-----END PRIVATE KEY-----&lt;/key&gt;Save the changes and close the file.Step 4.7:WindowsIf you’re using Windows, install the official OpenVPN client from here.After installation, paste your myphone.ovpn file here C:\Program Files\OpenVPN\config\.To connect to your VPN server, right-click the OpenVPN client in the taskbar and click Connect.To verify if you’re connected, go to Google and type What is my IP. If it returns the IP address of your OpenVPN server, all is well and your VPN is working as expected.macOSFor macOS, install Tunnelblick and import your .ovpn profile.Note: If you get an error and Tunnelblick is unable to connect, remove the following text from your .ovpn profile.# Prevent DNS leakblock-outside-dnsAndroidFor Android, download the OpenVPN Connect app from the Google Play Store. Import your .ovpn profile and you’re all set!iOSFor iPhone and iPad, download the OpenVPN Connect app from the Apple App Store. Import your .ovpn profile and you’re all set!Guess what? You’re done.I recommened you create separate .ovpn files for each of your devices instead of using the same key &amp; certificate for everything.To create .ovpn profiles for more devices, repeat steps from part 3 onwards.(header image source: commons.wikimedia.org)">

We do this because we are directly including the .crt and .key files within this .ovpn file.Before:# SSL/TLS parms.# . . .ca ca.crtcert client.crtkey client.keyAfter:# SSL/TLS parms.# . . .#ca ca.crt#cert client.crt#key client.keyStep 4.5:At the end of the file, add this text to block outside DNS# Prevent DNS leakblock-outside-dnsStep 4.6:Now, at the end of the file, we will be copying and pasting the contents of ca.crt, myphone.crt, and myphone.key files.Open the .crt and .key files in a text editor and copy-paste the content as shown belowThis is how we will be doing it.&lt;ca&gt;  (insert ca.crt here)&lt;/ca&gt;&lt;cert&gt;  (insert myphone.crt here)&lt;/cert&gt;&lt;key&gt;  (insert myphone.key here)&lt;/key&gt;Once you’re done copy-pasting the content, the end of your .ovpn file should look like this:&lt;ca&gt;-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----. . .-----END CERTIFICATE-----&lt;/ca&gt;  &lt;cert&gt;Certificate:. . .-----END CERTIFICATE-----. . .-----END CERTIFICATE-----&lt;/cert&gt;  &lt;key&gt;-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----. . .-----END PRIVATE KEY-----&lt;/key&gt;Save the changes and close the file.Step 4.7:WindowsIf you’re using Windows, install the official OpenVPN client from here.After installation, paste your myphone.ovpn file here C:\Program Files\OpenVPN\config\.To connect to your VPN server, right-click the OpenVPN client in the taskbar and click Connect.To verify if you’re connected, go to Google and type What is my IP. If it returns the IP address of your OpenVPN server, all is well and your VPN is working as expected.macOSFor macOS, install Tunnelblick and import your .ovpn profile.Note: If you get an error and Tunnelblick is unable to connect, remove the following text from your .ovpn profile.# Prevent DNS leakblock-outside-dnsAndroidFor Android, download the OpenVPN Connect app from the Google Play Store. Import your .ovpn profile and you’re all set!iOSFor iPhone and iPad, download the OpenVPN Connect app from the Apple App Store. Import your .ovpn profile and you’re all set!Guess what? You’re done.I recommened you create separate .ovpn files for each of your devices instead of using the same key &amp; certificate for everything.To create .ovpn profiles for more devices, repeat steps from part 3 onwards.(header image source: commons.wikimedia.org)">

    <meta itemprop="description" content="This is a detailed &amp; step-by-step guide that will show you how to install and configure OpenVPN on Ubuntu 14.04. You can use OpenVPN to access the Internet safely and securely while on the move. To learn more about OpenVPN, you can check out the Wikipedia link or read about it on the official siteWhat you need:  An Ubuntu 14.04 system.  Root access  And as always, an internet connectionThis guide is split into 4 main sections.Don’t worry if the titles look intimidating. If you follow the instructions, it should go smoothly and you should have a functioning OpenVPN server to which you can connect to from anywhere and using any device.  Installation and configuration of OpenVPN server  Creating a Certificate Authority and Server-Side Certificate and Key  Generate Certificates and Keys for your devices  Create a Unified OpenVPN Profile for each of your devicesPart 1Installation and configuration of OpenVPN serverStep 1.1:First, update your package lists and then install the openvpn and easy-rsa package.sudo apt-get updatesudo apt-get install openvpn easy-rsaStep 1.2:From now onwards, all the steps below have to be run as root. So, go ahead and login as root.suStep 1.3:Lets extract the sample VPN server configuration file to this location: /etc/openvpngunzip -c /usr/share/doc/openvpn/examples/sample-config-files/server.conf.gz &gt; /etc/openvpn/server.confNote: gunzip is a utility that uncompresses a gzip file. gz or .Z is the extension for gzip files.Step 1.4:Still as root, open this file.I prefer vim to open files on ubuntu. If you prefer nano instead, you can use that too.vi /etc/openvpn/server.confStep 1.5:Now, we have to modify a few lines in this file.Search for a section that looks like this# Diffie hellman parameters.# Generate your own with:#   openssl dhparam -out dh1024.pem 1024# Substitute 2048 for 1024 if you are using# 2048 bit keys.dh dh1024.pemChange dh1024.pem to dh2048.pem. This doubles the RSA key length when we generate the server and client keys later in the guide.Step 1.6:Find and uncomment the line below. To uncomment, simply remove the semicolon ; in front of the line.Before:# If enabled, this directive will configure# all clients to redirect their default# network gateway through the VPN, causing# all IP traffic such as web browsing and# and DNS lookups to go through the VPN# (The OpenVPN server machine may need to NAT# or bridge the TUN/TAP interface to the internet# in order for this to work properly).;push &quot;redirect-gateway def1 bypass-dhcp&quot;After:# If enabled, this directive will configure# all clients to redirect their default# network gateway through the VPN, causing# all IP traffic such as web browsing and# and DNS lookups to go through the VPN# (The OpenVPN server machine may need to NAT# or bridge the TUN/TAP interface to the internet# in order for this to work properly).push &quot;redirect-gateway def1 bypass-dhcp&quot;This makes sure that the OpenVPN server will pass the client device’s web traffic to its destination.Step 1.7:Still in the same file, find and uncomment the following two lines. To uncomment, simply remove the semicolon ; in front of the two lines.Before:# Certain Windows-specific network settings# can be pushed to clients, such as DNS# or WINS server addresses.  CAVEAT:# http://openvpn.net/faq.html#dhcpcaveats# The addresses below refer to the public# DNS servers provided by opendns.com.;push &quot;dhcp-option DNS 208.67.222.222&quot;;push &quot;dhcp-option DNS 208.67.220.220&quot;After:# Certain Windows-specific network settings# can be pushed to clients, such as DNS# or WINS server addresses.  CAVEAT:# http://openvpn.net/faq.html#dhcpcaveats# The addresses below refer to the public# DNS servers provided by opendns.com.push &quot;dhcp-option DNS 208.67.222.222&quot;push &quot;dhcp-option DNS 208.67.220.220&quot;The two IP addresses above belong to OpenDNS and will be used to lookup DNS request where possible. You can use any DNS service of your choice. Here we have used OpenDNS, and hence their IP addresses are listed in the file.Step 1.8:This is the last thing to change in the file. Look for this section below and uncomment the two lines by removing the semicolons ;Before:# You can uncomment this out on# non-Windows systems.;user nobody;group nogroupAfter:# You can uncomment this out on# non-Windows systems.user nobodygroup nogroupSave and close the file.Step 1.9:Packet ForwardingWe need to now enable an option that allows the server to forward traffic from client devices out to the Internet. If this is not done, the client traffic will stop at the server. To enable packet forwarding, run this command.echo 1 &gt; /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forwardThis setting is not yet permanent and will not survive a reboot. To make it permanent, we need to edit the sysctl.conf file.vi /etc/sysctl.confIn this file, find and uncomment the following line. To uncomment, remove the # in front of the line.Before:# Uncomment the next line to enable packet forwarding for IPv4#net.ipv4.ip_forward=1After:# Uncomment the next line to enable packet forwarding for IPv4net.ipv4.ip_forward=1Save the file and exit.Step 1.10:Set up firewall rules in the Uncomplicated Firewall (ufw)We will be using OpenVPN over UDP, so the firewall must allow UDP traffic over port 1194.Still as root, enter the following command:ufw allow 1194/udpOpen the firewall’s (ufw) primary configuration file. We habe to set the firewall forwarding policy.vi /etc/default/ufwSearch for the string DEFAULT_FORWARD_POLICY=&quot;DROP&quot; in this file. Change the DROP to ACCEPT.Before:DEFAULT_FORWARD_POLICY=&quot;DROP&quot;After:DEFAULT_FORWARD_POLICY=&quot;ACCEPT&quot;Save the file and exit.Step 1.11:There’s one more step before we can move on to the next section.We need to add add additional firewall rules.Open this filevi /etc/ufw/before.rulesWe will be adding rules for NAT (network address translation) and IP masquerading of connected devices.Modify this file to look like this.Before:## rules.before## Rules that should be run before the ufw command line added rules. Custom# rules should be added to one of these chains:#   ufw-before-input#   ufw-before-output#   ufw-before-forward## Don&#39;t delete these required lines, otherwise there will be errors*filterAfter:## rules.before## Rules that should be run before the ufw command line added rules. Custom# rules should be added to one of these chains:#   ufw-before-input#   ufw-before-output#   ufw-before-forward################################### START OPENVPN RULES# NAT table rules*nat:POSTROUTING ACCEPT [0:0] # Allow traffic from OpenVPN client to eth0-A POSTROUTING -s 10.8.0.0/8 -o eth0 -j MASQUERADECOMMIT# END OPENVPN RULES################################## Don&#39;t delete these required lines, otherwise there will be errors*filterOnce you’ve added the section, enable the firewall (ufw).ufw enable                   Part 2Creating a Certificate Authority and Server-Side Certificate and KeyOkay, so we have installed and configured OpenVPN and the firewall settings in the above section. Now, let’s go ahead and create certificates and keys for our new OpenVPN server.Creating a certificate authority (CA)Step 2.1:Make sure you’re still logged in as root.Copy the Easy-RSA generation scripts to /etc/openvpncp -r /usr/share/easy-rsa/ /etc/openvpnStep 2.2:Now, create a directory to store our keys.mkdir /etc/openvpn/easy-rsa/keysStep 2.3:Now we will edit the vars file and add in some default values for a person or a business. The information that is entered into this file will be copied to the certificates and keys and will help us in identifying them later.You can put in any values you like. Here is an example.export KEY_COUNTRY=&quot;CA&quot;export KEY_PROVINCE=&quot;ON&quot;export KEY_CITY=&quot;Toronto&quot;export KEY_ORG=&quot;Wiseindy&quot;export KEY_EMAIL=&quot;wiseindy@example.com&quot;export KEY_OU=&quot;WiseOU&quot;There is one more line to edit in this file before you close it. We need to set the default filename for the server key and certificate. In this tutorial we’ve used the name server for simplicity. If you’re using a different name, please make sure you replace server with your custom name in the commands.export KEY_NAME=&quot;server&quot;Save and close the file.Step 2.4:The next step is to generate the Diffie-Hellman parameters.openssl dhparam -out /etc/openvpn/dh2048.pem 2048Step 2.5:Now, navigate to the easy-rsa directory.cd /etc/openvpn/easy-rsaStep 2.6:Once you’re in the easy-rsa directory, run the following command to initialize the PKI (Public Key Infrastructure).. ./varsNote the . (dot) and ` ` (space) in front of ./vars.The above command will output the following:NOTE: If you run ./clean-all, I will be doing a rm -rf on /etc/openvpn/easy-rsa/keysYou can ignore this warning message since we haven’t yet generated anything.Step 2.7:Let’s clear the working directory of any example keys and start fresh../clean-allStep 2.8:We are all set to create our certificate authority now. When you run the following command, it will ask you to confirm the values you had entered in the vars file in step 2.6. Hit enter to confirm the values../build-caGenerate a Certificate and Key for the ServerStep 2.9:Well, we now have a certificate authority (CA) set up. Let’s build our server key now../build-key-server serverNote: Note that I’ve used the name server in the above command. This is because I’ve set export KEY_NAME=&quot;server&quot; in the vars file (step 2.6). If you’ve used a different name, make sure you modify the command accordinglyWhen you run this command, you’ll see a similar output as the previous step. You can hit enter to confirm them. However, this time you will see two additional prompts.Please enter the following &#39;extra&#39; attributesto be sent with your certificate requestA challenge password []:An optional company name []:Both of the should be left blank. Hit Enter to continue.When it prompts you to sign the certificate and commit, type y for both the prompts and hit enter.Sign the certificate? [y/n]  y1 out of 1 certificate requests certified, commit? [y/n]  yNow you should see the following output. This means that all is good so far.Write out database with 1 new entriesData Base UpdatedStep 2.10Move the Server Certificates and KeysWell, we’ve now generated the server CA, keys and certificate. Let’s copy these over to the correct location /etc/openvpn/.cp /etc/openvpn/easy-rsa/keys/{server.crt,server.key,ca.crt} /etc/openvpnStep 2.11Well, guess what? Our OpenVPN server is ready now. Let’s start it.service openvpn startPart 3Generate Certificates and Keys for your devicesIn the previous section, we created the key and certificate for our server. We are going to do that for our devices now.We will build one for a client device called myphone. You can name your client device anything. Just make sure to substitute the name in the commands that follow.Step 3.1:You should still be root and still working from this directory /etc/openvpn/easy-rsa../build-key myphoneLike in the previous steps, you’ll be asked to confirm the Distinguised Name variables. Hit enter to accept the defaults.Step 3.2:Now copy the sample client configuration file to the easy-rsa/keys directory. This file will be used as a template. We will be editing this template file for each of our devices.cp /usr/share/doc/openvpn/examples/sample-config-files/client.conf /etc/openvpn/easy-rsa/keys/myphone.ovpnYou can repeat this section (steps 3.1 and 3.2) for each client device. Just make sure you use a different name for each of your devices (in this case we’ve used myphone)Part 4Create a Unified OpenVPN Profile for each of your devicesNow that you have created keys and certificates for your device myphone, let’s create one unified .ovpn file which will contain all this information.Step 4.1:From the /etc/openvpn/easy-rsa directory, copy the following files to your computer (the one you’re reading this article on). We will be editing these in a text editor (Notepad, TextEdit, etc.).myphone.crtmyphone.keymyphone.ovpnca.crtStep 4.2Open the myphone.ovpn file in a text editor like Notepad (Windows) or TextEdit (macOS) or whatever you prefere, really.Add your server’s IP address to the this section in the beginning of the file. Replace my-server-1 with your server’s IP address.Before:# The hostname/IP and port of the server.# You can have multiple remote entries# to load balance between the servers.remote my-server-1 1194After:# The hostname/IP and port of the server.# You can have multiple remote entries# to load balance between the servers.remote 142.189.11.1 1194Step 4.3In the same file, scroll down and uncomment this section (This doesn’t apply to Windows, so you can skip it if you’re going to use thie VPN profile on a Windows machine).Before:# Downgrade privileges after initialization (non-Windows only);user nobody;group nogroupAfter:# Downgrade privileges after initialization (non-Windows only)user nobodygroup nogroupStep 4.4:Scroll further down and this time you’ll comment a few lines instead of uncommenting. We do this because we are directly including the .crt and .key files within this .ovpn file.Before:# SSL/TLS parms.# . . .ca ca.crtcert client.crtkey client.keyAfter:# SSL/TLS parms.# . . .#ca ca.crt#cert client.crt#key client.keyStep 4.5:At the end of the file, add this text to block outside DNS# Prevent DNS leakblock-outside-dnsStep 4.6:Now, at the end of the file, we will be copying and pasting the contents of ca.crt, myphone.crt, and myphone.key files.Open the .crt and .key files in a text editor and copy-paste the content as shown belowThis is how we will be doing it.&lt;ca&gt;  (insert ca.crt here)&lt;/ca&gt;&lt;cert&gt;  (insert myphone.crt here)&lt;/cert&gt;&lt;key&gt;  (insert myphone.key here)&lt;/key&gt;Once you’re done copy-pasting the content, the end of your .ovpn file should look like this:&lt;ca&gt;-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----. . .-----END CERTIFICATE-----&lt;/ca&gt;  &lt;cert&gt;Certificate:. . .-----END CERTIFICATE-----. . .-----END CERTIFICATE-----&lt;/cert&gt;  &lt;key&gt;-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----. . .-----END PRIVATE KEY-----&lt;/key&gt;Save the changes and close the file.Step 4.7:WindowsIf you’re using Windows, install the official OpenVPN client from here.After installation, paste your myphone.ovpn file here C:\Program Files\OpenVPN\config\.To connect to your VPN server, right-click the OpenVPN client in the taskbar and click Connect.To verify if you’re connected, go to Google and type What is my IP.

<div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">gunzip</span> <span class="nt">-c</span> /usr/share/doc/openvpn/examples/sample-config-files/server.conf.gz <span class="o">&gt;</span> /etc/openvpn/server.conf
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><em>Note: <code class="highlighter-rouge">gunzip</code> is a utility that uncompresses a <code class="highlighter-rouge">gzip</code> file. <code class="highlighter-rouge">gz</code> or <code class="highlighter-rouge">.Z</code> is the extension for <code class="highlighter-rouge">gzip</code> files.</em></p>

<h3 id="step-14">Step 1.4:</h3>

<p>Still as root, open this file.</p>

<p>I prefer <code class="highlighter-rouge">vim</code> to open files on ubuntu. If you prefer <code class="highlighter-rouge">nano</code> instead, you can use that too.</p>

<div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>vi /etc/openvpn/server.conf
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="step-15">Step 1.5:</h3>

<p>Now, we have to modify a few lines in this file.</p>

<p>Search for a section that looks like this</p>

<div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c"># Diffie hellman parameters.</span>
<span class="c"># Generate your own with:</span>
<span class="c">#   openssl dhparam -out dh1024.pem 1024</span>
<span class="c"># Substitute 2048 for 1024 if you are using</span>
<span class="c"># 2048 bit keys.</span>
dh dh1024.pem
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Change <code class="highlighter-rouge">dh1024.pem</code> to <code class="highlighter-rouge">dh2048.pem</code>. This doubles the RSA key length when we generate the server and client keys later in the guide.</p>

<h3 id="step-16">Step 1.6:</h3>

<p>Find and uncomment the line below. To uncomment, simply remove the semicolon <code class="highlighter-rouge">;</code> in front of the line.</p>

<p>Before:</p>

<div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c"># If enabled, this directive will configure</span>
<span class="c"># all clients to redirect their default</span>
<span class="c"># network gateway through the VPN, causing</span>
<span class="c"># all IP traffic such as web browsing and</span>
<span class="c"># and DNS lookups to go through the VPN</span>
<span class="c"># (The OpenVPN server machine may need to NAT</span>
<span class="c"># or bridge the TUN/TAP interface to the internet</span>
<span class="c"># in order for this to work properly).</span>
<span class="p">;</span>push <span class="s2">"redirect-gateway def1 bypass-dhcp"</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>After:</p>

<div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c"># If enabled, this directive will configure</span>
<span class="c"># all clients to redirect their default</span>
<span class="c"># network gateway through the VPN, causing</span>

<span class="c"># and DNS lookups to go through the VPN</span>
<span class="c"># (The OpenVPN server machine may need to NAT</span>
<span class="c"># or bridge the TUN/TAP interface to the internet</span>
<span class="c"># in order for this to work properly).</span>
push <span class="s2">"redirect-gateway def1 bypass-dhcp"</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This makes sure that the OpenVPN server will pass the client device’s web traffic to its destination.</p>

<h3 id="step-17">Step 1.7:</h3>

<p>Still in the same file, find and uncomment the following two lines. To uncomment, simply remove the semicolon <code class="highlighter-rouge">;</code> in front of the two lines.</p>

<p>Before:</p>

<div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c"># Certain Windows-specific network settings</span>
<span class="c"># can be pushed to clients, such as DNS</span>
<span class="c"># or WINS server addresses.  CAVEAT:</span>

<span class="p">;</span>push <span class="s2">"dhcp-option DNS 208.67.222.222"</span>
<span class="p">;</span>push <span class="s2">"dhcp-option DNS 208.67.220.220"</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>After:</p>

<div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c"># Certain Windows-specific network settings</span>
<span class="c"># can be pushed to clients, such as DNS</span>
<span class="c"># or WINS server addresses.  CAVEAT:</span>

push <span class="s2">"dhcp-option DNS 208.67.220.220"</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The two IP addresses above belong to OpenDNS and will be used to lookup DNS request where possible. You can use any DNS service of your choice. Here we have used OpenDNS, and hence their IP addresses are listed in the file.</p>

<h3 id="step-18">Step 1.8:</h3>

<p>This is the last thing to change in the file. Look for this section below and uncomment the two lines by removing the semicolons <code class="highlighter-rouge">;</code></p>

<p>Before:</p>

<div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c"># You can uncomment this out on</span>
<span class="c"># non-Windows systems.</span>
<span class="p">;</span>user nobody

<p>After:</p>

<div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c"># You can uncomment this out on</span>
<span class="c"># non-Windows systems.</span>
user nobody
group nogroup
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Save and close the file.</p>

<h3 id="step-19">Step 1.9:</h3>

<h4 id="packet-forwarding">Packet Forwarding</h4>

<p>We need to now enable an option that allows the server to forward traffic from client devices out to the Internet. If this is not done, the client traffic will stop at the server. To enable packet forwarding, run this command.</p>

<div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">echo </span>1 <span class="o">&gt;</span> /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This setting is not yet permanent and will not survive a reboot. To make it permanent, we need to edit the <code class="highlighter-rouge">sysctl.conf</code> file.</p>

<div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>vi /etc/sysctl.conf
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In this file, find and uncomment the following line. To uncomment, remove the <code class="highlighter-rouge">#</code> in front of the line.</p>

<p>Before:</p>

<div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c"># Uncomment the next line to enable packet forwarding for IPv4</span>
<span class="c">#net.ipv4.ip_forward=1</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>After:</p>

<div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c"># Uncomment the next line to enable packet forwarding for IPv4</span>
net.ipv4.ip_forward<span class="o">=</span>1
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Save the file and exit.</p>

<h3 id="step-110">Step 1.10:</h3>

<h4 id="set-up-firewall-rules-in-the-uncomplicated-firewall-ufw">Set up firewall rules in the Uncomplicated Firewall (ufw)</h4>

<p>We will be using OpenVPN over UDP, so the firewall must allow UDP traffic over port <strong>1194</strong>.</p>

<p>Still as root, enter the following command:</p>

<div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>ufw allow 1194/udp
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Open the firewall’s (ufw) primary configuration file. We habe to set the firewall forwarding policy.</p>

<div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>vi /etc/default/ufw
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Search for the string <code class="highlighter-rouge">DEFAULT_FORWARD_POLICY="DROP"</code> in this file. Change the <code class="highlighter-rouge">DROP</code> to <code class="highlighter-rouge">ACCEPT</code>.</p>

<p>Before:</p>

<div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nv">DEFAULT_FORWARD_POLICY</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">"DROP"</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Save the file and exit.</p>

<h3 id="step-111">Step 1.11:</h3>

<p>There’s one more step before we can move on to the next section.</p>

<p>We need to add add additional firewall rules.</p>

<p>Open this file</p>

<div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>vi /etc/ufw/before.rules
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We will be adding rules for NAT (network address translation) and IP masquerading of connected devices.</p>

<p>Modify this file to look like this.</p>

<p>Before:</p>

<div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c">#</span>
<span class="c"># rules.before</span>
<span class="c">#</span>

<h2 id="creating-a-certificate-authority-and-server-side-certificate-and-key">Creating a Certificate Authority and Server-Side Certificate and Key</h2>

<p>Okay, so we have installed and configured OpenVPN and the firewall settings in the above section. Now, let’s go ahead and create certificates and keys for our new OpenVPN server.</p>

<h4 id="creating-a-certificate-authority-ca">Creating a certificate authority (CA)</h4>

<h3 id="step-21">Step 2.1:</h3>

<p>Make sure you’re still logged in as root.</p>

<p>Copy the Easy-RSA generation scripts to <code class="highlighter-rouge">/etc/openvpn</code></p>

<div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">cp</span> <span class="nt">-r</span> /usr/share/easy-rsa/ /etc/openvpn
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="step-22">Step 2.2:</h3>

<p>Now, create a directory to store our keys.</p>

<div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">mkdir</span> /etc/openvpn/easy-rsa/keys
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="step-23">Step 2.3:</h3>

<p>Now we will edit the <code class="highlighter-rouge">vars</code> file and add in some default values for a person or a business. The information that is entered into this file will be copied to the certificates and keys and will help us in identifying them later.</p>

<p>You can put in any values you like. Here is an example.</p>

<div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">export </span><span class="nv">KEY_COUNTRY</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">"CA"</span>
<span class="nb">export </span><span class="nv">KEY_PROVINCE</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">"ON"</span>
<span class="nb">export </span><span class="nv">KEY_CITY</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">"Toronto"</span>
<span class="nb">export </span><span class="nv">KEY_ORG</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">"Wiseindy"</span>
<span class="nb">export </span><span class="nv">KEY_EMAIL</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">"wiseindy@example.com"</span>
<span class="nb">export </span><span class="nv">KEY_OU</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">"WiseOU"</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>There is one more line to edit in this file before you close it. We need to set the default filename for the server key and certificate. In this tutorial we’ve used the name <code class="highlighter-rouge">server</code> for simplicity. If you’re using a different name, please make sure you replace <code class="highlighter-rouge">server</code> with your custom name in the commands.</p>

<div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">export </span><span class="nv">KEY_NAME</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">"server"</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Save and close the file.</p>

<h3 id="step-24">Step 2.4:</h3>

<p>The next step is to generate the Diffie-Hellman parameters.</p>

<div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>openssl dhparam <span class="nt">-out</span> /etc/openvpn/dh2048.pem 2048
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="step-25">Step 2.5:</h3>

<p>Now, navigate to the <code class="highlighter-rouge">easy-rsa</code> directory.</p>

<div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">cd</span> /etc/openvpn/easy-rsa
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="step-26">Step 2.6:</h3>

<p>Once you’re in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">easy-rsa</code> directory, run the following command to initialize the PKI (Public Key Infrastructure).</p>

<div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">.</span> ./vars
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Note the <code class="highlighter-rouge">.</code> (dot) and ` ` (space) in front of <code class="highlighter-rouge">./vars</code>.</p>

<p>The above command will output the following:</p>

<div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>NOTE: If you run ./clean-all, I will be doing a <span class="nb">rm</span> <span class="nt">-rf</span> on /etc/openvpn/easy-rsa/keys
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You can ignore this warning message since we haven’t yet generated anything.</p>

<h3 id="step-27">Step 2.7:</h3>

<p>Let’s clear the working directory of any example keys and start fresh.</p>

<div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>./clean-all
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="step-28">Step 2.8:</h3>

<p>We are all set to create our certificate authority now. When you run the following command, it will ask you to confirm the values you had entered in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">vars</code> file in step 2.6. Hit enter to confirm the values.</p>

<div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>./build-ca
</code></pre></div></div>

<h4 id="generate-a-certificate-and-key-for-the-server">Generate a Certificate and Key for the Server</h4>

<h3 id="step-29">Step 2.9:</h3>

<p>Well, we now have a certificate authority (CA) set up. Let’s build our server key now.</p>

<div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>./build-key-server server
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><em>Note: Note that I’ve used the name <strong>server</strong> in the above command. This is because I’ve set <code class="highlighter-rouge">export KEY_NAME="server"</code> in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">vars</code> file (step 2.6). If you’ve used a different name, make sure you modify the command accordingly</em></p>

<p>When you run this command, you’ll see a similar output as the previous step. You can hit enter to confirm them. However, this time you will see two additional prompts.</p>

<div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Please enter the following <span class="s1">'extra'</span> attributes
to be sent with your certificate request
A challenge password <span class="o">[]</span>:
An optional company name <span class="o">[]</span>:
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Both of the should be left blank. Hit Enter to continue.</p>

<p>When it prompts you to sign the certificate and commit, type <code class="highlighter-rouge">y</code> for both the prompts and hit enter.</p>

<div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Sign the certificate? <span class="o">[</span>y/n]  y
1 out of 1 certificate requests certified, commit? <span class="o">[</span>y/n]  y
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now you should see the following output. This means that all is good so far.</p>

<div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Write out database with 1 new entries
Data Base Updated
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="step-210">Step 2.10</h3>

<h4 id="move-the-server-certificates-and-keys">Move the Server Certificates and Keys</h4>

<p>Well, we’ve now generated the server CA, keys and certificate. Let’s copy these over to the correct location <code class="highlighter-rouge">/etc/openvpn/</code>.</p>

<div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">cp</span> /etc/openvpn/easy-rsa/keys/<span class="o">{</span>server.crt,server.key,ca.crt<span class="o">}</span> /etc/openvpn
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="step-211">Step 2.11</h3>

<p>Well, guess what? Our OpenVPN server is ready now. Let’s start it.</p>

<div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>service openvpn start
</code></pre></div></div>

<h1 id="part-3">Part 3</h1>

<h2 id="generate-certificates-and-keys-for-your-devices">Generate Certificates and Keys for your devices</h2>

<p>In the previous section, we created the key and certificate for our server. We are going to do that for our devices now.</p>

<p>We will build one for a client device called <code class="highlighter-rouge">myphone</code>. You can name your client device anything. Just make sure to substitute the name in the commands that follow.</p>

<h3 id="step-31">Step 3.1:</h3>

<p>You should still be root and still working from this directory <code class="highlighter-rouge">/etc/openvpn/easy-rsa</code>.</p>

<div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>./build-key myphone
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Like in the previous steps, you’ll be asked to confirm the Distinguised Name variables. Hit enter to accept the defaults.</p>

<h3 id="step-32">Step 3.2:</h3>

<p>Now copy the sample client configuration file to the <code class="highlighter-rouge">easy-rsa/keys</code> directory. This file will be used as a template. We will be editing this template file for each of our devices.</p>

<div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">cp</span> /usr/share/doc/openvpn/examples/sample-config-files/client.conf /etc/openvpn/easy-rsa/keys/myphone.ovpn
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You can repeat this section (steps 3.1 and 3.2) for each client device. Just make sure you use a different name for each of your devices (in this case we’ve used <code class="highlighter-rouge">myphone</code>)</p>

<h1 id="part-4">Part 4</h1>

<h2 id="create-a-unified-openvpn-profile-for-each-of-your-devices">Create a Unified OpenVPN Profile for each of your devices</h2>

<p>Now that you have created keys and certificates for your device <code class="highlighter-rouge">myphone</code>, let’s create one unified <code class="highlighter-rouge">.ovpn</code> file which will contain all this information.</p>

<h3 id="step-41">Step 4.1:</h3>

<p>From the <code class="highlighter-rouge">/etc/openvpn/easy-rsa</code> directory, copy the following files to your computer (the one you’re reading this article on). We will be editing these in a text editor (Notepad, TextEdit, etc.).</p>

<div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>myphone.crt
myphone.key
myphone.ovpn
ca.crt
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="step-42">Step 4.2</h3>

<p>Open the <code class="highlighter-rouge">myphone.ovpn</code> file in a text editor like Notepad (Windows) or TextEdit (macOS) or whatever you prefere, really.</p>

<p>Add your server’s IP address to the this section in the beginning of the file. Replace <code class="highlighter-rouge">my-server-1</code> with your server’s IP address.</p>

<p>Before:</p>

<div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c"># The hostname/IP and port of the server.</span>
<span class="c"># You can have multiple remote entries</span>
<span class="c"># to load balance between the servers.</span>
remote my-server-1 1194
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>After:</p>

<div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c"># The hostname/IP and port of the server.</span>
<span class="c"># You can have multiple remote entries</span>
<span class="c"># to load balance between the servers.</span>
remote 142.189.11.1 1194
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="step-43">Step 4.3</h3>

<p>In the same file, scroll down and uncomment this section (This doesn’t apply to Windows, so you can skip it if you’re going to use thie VPN profile on a Windows machine).</p>

<p>Before:</p>

<div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c"># Downgrade privileges after initialization (non-Windows only)</span>
<span class="p">;</span>user nobody
<span class="p">;</span>group nogroup
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>After:</p>

<div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c"># Downgrade privileges after initialization (non-Windows only)</span>
user nobody
group nogroup
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="step-44">Step 4.4:</h3>

<p>Scroll further down and this time you’ll <strong>comment</strong> a few lines instead of uncommenting. We do this because we are directly including the <code class="highlighter-rouge">.crt</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">.key</code> files within this <code class="highlighter-rouge">.ovpn</code> file.</p>

<p>Before:</p>

<div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c"># SSL/TLS parms.</span>
<span class="c"># . . .</span>
ca ca.crt

<p>After:</p>

<div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c"># SSL/TLS parms.</span>
<span class="c"># . . .</span>
<span class="c">#ca ca.crt</span>
<span class="c">#cert client.crt</span>
<span class="c">#key client.key</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="step-45">Step 4.5:</h3>

<p>At the end of the file, add this text to block outside DNS</p>

<div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c"># Prevent DNS leak</span>
block-outside-dns
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="step-46">Step 4.6:</h3>

<p>Now, at the end of the file, we will be copying and pasting the contents of <code class="highlighter-rouge">ca.crt</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">myphone.crt</code>, and <code class="highlighter-rouge">myphone.key</code> files.</p>

<p>Open the <code class="highlighter-rouge">.crt</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">.key</code> files in a text editor and copy-paste the content as shown below</p>

<p>This is how we will be doing it.</p>

<div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>&lt;ca&gt;
  <span class="o">(</span>insert ca.crt here<span class="o">)</span>
&lt;/ca&gt;

&lt;cert&gt;
  <span class="o">(</span>insert myphone.crt here<span class="o">)</span>
&lt;/cert&gt;

&lt;key&gt;
  <span class="o">(</span>insert myphone.key here<span class="o">)</span>
&lt;/key&gt;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Once you’re done copy-pasting the content, the end of your <code class="highlighter-rouge">.ovpn</code> file should look like this:</p>

<div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>&lt;ca&gt;
<span class="nt">-----BEGIN</span> CERTIFICATE-----
<span class="nb">.</span> <span class="nb">.</span> <span class="nb">.</span>
<span class="nt">-----END</span> CERTIFICATE-----
&lt;/ca&gt;
  
&lt;cert&gt;
Certificate:
<span class="nb">.</span> <span class="nb">.</span> <span class="nb">.</span>
<span class="nt">-----END</span> CERTIFICATE-----
<span class="nb">.</span> <span class="nb">.</span> <span class="nb">.</span>
<span class="nt">-----END</span> CERTIFICATE-----
&lt;/cert&gt;
  
&lt;key&gt;
<span class="nt">-----BEGIN</span> PRIVATE KEY-----
<span class="nb">.</span> <span class="nb">.</span> <span class="nb">.</span>
<span class="nt">-----END</span> PRIVATE KEY-----
&lt;/key&gt;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Save the changes and close the file.</p>

<h3 id="step-47">Step 4.7:</h3>

<h4 id="windows">Windows</h4>
<p>If you’re using Windows, install the official <a href="https://openvpn.net/index.php/open-source/downloads.html">OpenVPN client from here</a>.
After installation, paste your <code class="highlighter-rouge">myphone.ovpn</code> file here <code class="highlighter-rouge">C:\Program Files\OpenVPN\config\</code>.</p>

<p>To connect to your VPN server, right-click the OpenVPN client in the taskbar and click <strong>Connect</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/posts/2017-04-27-install-openvpn-ubuntu-1404-001.png" alt="Connect to OpenVPN" title="Connect to OpenVPN" /></p>

<p>To verify if you’re connected, go to <a href="https://google.com">Google</a> and type <code class="highlighter-rouge">What is my IP</code>. If it returns the IP address of your OpenVPN server, all is well and your VPN is working as expected.</p>

<h4 id="macos">macOS</h4>
<p>For macOS, install <a href="https://tunnelblick.net/downloads.html">Tunnelblick</a> and import your <code class="highlighter-rouge">.ovpn</code> profile.
<strong>Note:</strong> If you get an error and Tunnelblick is unable to connect, remove the following text from your <code class="highlighter-rouge">.ovpn</code> profile.</p>

<div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c"># Prevent DNS leak</span>
block-outside-dns
</code></pre></div></div>

<h4 id="android">Android</h4>
<p>For Android, download the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.openvpn.openvpn&amp;hl=en">OpenVPN Connect app from the Google Play Store</a>. Import your <code class="highlighter-rouge">.ovpn</code> profile and you’re all set!</p>

<h4 id="ios">iOS</h4>
<p>For iPhone and iPad, download the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/openvpn-connect/id590379981?mt=8">OpenVPN Connect app from the Apple App Store</a>. Import your <code class="highlighter-rouge">.ovpn</code> profile and you’re all set!</p>

<p>Guess what? You’re done.</p>

<p>I recommened you create separate <code class="highlighter-rouge">.ovpn</code> files for each of your devices instead of using the same key &amp; certificate for everything.</p>

<p><strong>To create <code class="highlighter-rouge">.ovpn</code> profiles for more devices, <a href="#part-3">repeat steps from part 3 onwards</a>.</strong></p>
